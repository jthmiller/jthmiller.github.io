Research Assistant Professor  
Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences  
University of New Hampshire, Durham NH  
August 2023-Current    

# EDUCATION:

University of California, Davis, Ph.D., Pharmacology and Toxicology, December 2018  
Saint Cloud State University, MS, Cell and Molecular Biology, May 2012  
Minnesota State University Moorhead, BA, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, May 2009  

# PREVIOUS APPOINTMENTS:
Project Scientist - University of New Hampshire, Civil and Environmental Engineering

  * Bioinformatics and statistical analysis of eDNA samples with Alison Watts, Civil and Environmental Engineering 

Bioinformatics Analyst - University of Minnesota, Minnesota Supercomputer Institute

  * Cancer genomics. Bulk/single-cell gene expression profiling. Whole genome structural analysis of leukemia and prostate cancer, including human controlled-access data. Clinical and research pipeline development with SLURM, PBS, AWS, Docker, and git.
  
Postdoctoral Scholar - University of Minnesota, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior

  * Identification of the premature termination codons and molecular mechanisms that contribute to cave and surface phenotypes of Astyanax mexicanus. Analyzed multiple population whole-genome sequences and gene expression profiles to associate genetic variation with cavefish phenotypes.

Graduate Research - University of California Davis, Department of Environmental Toxicology

  * Mapping the Genetic Basis of Rapid Evolution to Industrial Pollutants in Atlantic Killifish. Conducted a comparative analysis of genome structure of killifish and other sequenced vertebrates. Used a quantitative genomic approach to determine the architecture of rapidly evolved resistance to the teratogenicity of pollutants in coastal killifish populations.
