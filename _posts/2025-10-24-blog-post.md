Our partners at Southeast Land Trust of New Hampshire highlighted our pilot study to use eDNA collecting in spider webs to monitor forest wildlife. Check out David Johnson article in SELT's Understory Magazine [here](https://tinyurl.com/spiderweb-eDNA). We will also share this work with colleagues at the Monadnock Region Natural History Conference [MRNHC](https://harriscenter.org/conservation-research/monadnock-region-natural-history-conference) on November 15th.
